        <p>The Year Long Training gives another option to complete the Basic Training in Gestalt Therapy with Children and Adolescents:  The Oaklander Approach over a period of ten months.     This option covers the same curriculum and provides the same materials as the Summer Intensive.  This option is taught by Felicia Carroll along with Core Faculty Valente Orozco and Stephanie Pawlowicz with support from Adjunct Faculty.</p>
        <p>Participants will meet approximately every two months in Solvang, CA for 10 contact hours. At the conclusion 60 contact hours will be completed. Participants are committed to attend each week-end.  No partial credit is given and the participant cannot choose among week-ends.  Participants are responsible for the full payment even if they are not able to attend a week-end for any reason.   No refunds will be made after the program begins. The program is limited to 10 participants.</p>
