                <p>Sand Tray is an indispensable resource in the therapeutic journey with children and adolescents.    This workshop focuses on using the non-analytical, phenomenological approach of Gestalt Therapy which deepens the child's awareness and strengthens the child's sense of self, essential elements in the integrative process.   This workshop is designed for both those new to sand tray as well as experienced therapists.</p>
