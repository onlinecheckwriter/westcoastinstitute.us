                <p>It is not uncommon for an adopted child’s grief to be unseen in therapy.  This workshop which is led by an a specialist in the therapy of foster families and adopted children (who herself is an adoptee) will focus on the many issues that become present in therapy, but especially how grief manifests in the behavior, emotions, and the beliefs of self.    The approach of Gestalt Play Therapy in this specialized area will be presented through research, theoretical perspective, and case presentation.</p>

                <hr/>
                <p>How do we become who we are? Having an integrated theoretical perspective on the dynamics of human development is essential to being an effective play therapist regardless of clinical orientation. A developmental view informs observations and choices in the play therapy room as well as in assessment and treatment planning.</p>
                <p>This training will establish an historical and contemporary understanding of the Gestalt Perspective on Child/Adolescent Development. The roots of the Gestalt Perspective on Child/Adolescent Development are deep into Psychoanalysis, Gestalt Psychology (how meaning is made) and Field Theory (the mutual relationship between child and environment). Concepts and understandings evolved with Humanistic perspectives. Developmental theories from Piaget to current neurobiology have also been significant in the evolution of perspective by Gestalt play therapists. The Organismic/Relational/Neurobiology view about how the child becomes who they are and forms a sense of self will be the focus of this training. This can deepen the effectiveness of the Gestalt play therapist in supporting her young clients to healthful, alive development. Attention will be given not only to normative principles but also to neuro- cultural-, and economic-diversity.</p>

                <p>Play therapists and other professionals working with children and adolescents are constantly challenged with adequately applying neuroscientific knowledge in their practice.  One of the primary foundations of Gestalt therapy with children and adolescents is Gestalt Psychology and studies on complex organisms.  Consequently, Gestalt Play Therapy contains many aspects of contemporary neuroscience.  Understanding when and why and how some parts of the brain are activated with our interventions requires in-depth knowledge of mechanisms of the neurological system.  In this training, the participants will gain an understanding of the historical foundations of as well as the current neurobiological core principles in Gestalt Play Therapy.  They will be able to return to their clinical work with knowledge of the central nervous system and how the Gestalt approach to embodied approaches in therapy can help their young clients become integrated with minds that are coherent.</p>

                <p>The Advanced Intensive Training is planned for those wanting to continue with the work of the Basic Intensive and reunite with friends while doing so. The focus of the Advanced Training will be on Integrative processes such as working with children and adolescents on core issues of shame and disruptive beliefs about self and others and one’s place in the world.  These “introjects” shape the trajectory of a child’s life. The processes of self-nurturing and self-compassion and the writing of a life/trauma narrative can provide a foundation for healing and greater neural integration.  How to effectively use these processes in Gestalt Play Therapy with teens as well as younger children will be the focus of this four day training.</p>
