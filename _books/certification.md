        <h3 class="header-sm-title">Supervision / Case Consultation</h3>
        <p>Supervision/Case Consultation can provide an opportunity to develop a foundation in Gestalt theoretical principles and methods for clinical practice. The Gestalt perspective emphasizes the nature of the relational elf and the qualities of the therapeutic alliance. Gestalt Therapy offers the child therapist an alternative way of working relationally and creatively with her young clients. Gestalt Therapy continues to influence the theory and practice of most contemporary schools in psychotherapy as well as challenge the aassumptions of others. The fundamental principles of Gestalt Therapy are confirmed by attachment theory, relational neurobiology and neuroscience. The integration of these recent developments with contemporary Gestalt Therapy shape the perspective of the supervisory/consulting discussion.</p>
        <p><strong>Felicia Carroll, LMFT and RPT-S</strong> conducts supervision/consultation in groups, individually, and at a distance via Skype. Supervision/consultation is available to those who have completed training with Felicia Carroll or other qualified trainers.</p>
        <p>Other WCI faculty are available for supervision / consultation. See <a href="/faculty">Faculty</a> tab.</p>

     <p>On August 9, 2015, Valente Orozco, LCSW and RPT-S was given his certificate which acknowledged him as Certified Gestalt Therapist with Children and Adolescents through the West Coast Institute.   Valente completed all the requirements with honorable recognition.  He said upon completion, “I am extremely proud of this designation.  It means more to me than I can express at this time.”  Valente also wrote,  “The two year process has been invaluable in organizing and integrating so much theoretical and clinical information.  Time and effort well-spent.”</p>
     <p>There are now four other candidates who are well on their way toward completion and certification.  It is the hope of everyone involved with WCI that many more will follow so that this theoretical and clinical approach will continue to have a voice within the field of child psychotherapy wherever children and families need our help.</p>
